## Abstract

BitOQSim is designed as a way to simulate quantum computers and quantum
algorithms using classical computers.

In order for the language to be more transparent and educationally useful,
BitOQSim uses matrices in order to simulate qubits and quantum gates in a way
that is less esoteric than other high-level quantum simulators.  In testing,
BitOQSim has proven to be particularly useful in explaining how quantum gates
function and how to build quantum circuits.

## Disclaimer

BitOQSim is documented using Sphinx with reStructuredText as its markup
language.

BitOQSim was developed in Python 3.9.7, and Python 3.9.x is recommended,
although not required.

Useful resources used are included as links when relevant; however, although it
is recommended to look through the included resources, they are not required
reading.

BitOQSim is not an IBM product, and files that use Qiskit are explicitly
labeled as such.  Equivalent Qiskit implementations are included in order to be
used as points of comparison.
